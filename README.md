# Brazil-travel-price-calculator

This program uses the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the states in Brazil to calculate the price of travel between them.
It can be used to travel between any states or countries in the world, simply by entering their coordinates (the coordinates can be found on the internet or by chatGPT) into a python dictionary.
Change the value of the variables 'price1' and 'price2' to the values of the tickets you want. As well as entering the distances equivalent to the ticket prices
